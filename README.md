## About

In resume, **Morphose** is a data humanizer library writen in [PHP](http://php.net) that attempts to convert computing data (namely bytes) into a descriptive output that humans can easily read. But it does more than that:

- It can cast between different data units.
- It can convert humananized data into computing data.
- It has a **CLI** utility.
- It is available as a [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/morphose/morphose) package and so easily compatible with any application that uses it.

## Documentation

We have writen a good [documentation](https://morphose.github.io) that tries to cover everything you need to know to get full advantage of **Morphose**.
