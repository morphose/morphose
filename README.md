## About

In resume, **Shannon** is a data humanizer library writen in [PHP](http://php.net) that attempts to convert computing data (namely bytes) into a descriptive output that humans can easily read. It is available as a [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/morphose/shannon) package. We have plans to boost **Shannon** to do more than that:

- It could cast between different data units.
- It could convert humananized data into computing data.
- It could have a **CLI** utility.

## Documentation

We are writing a nice [documentation](https://morphose.github.io/shannon) that tries to cover everything you need to know to get full advantage of **Shannon**.

## Contributing

Contributions can be made via pull requests. Changes will be merged into the main project as long they comply to the [adhered code standards](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and the purposes of this library.
